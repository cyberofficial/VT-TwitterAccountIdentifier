### VT-TwitterAccountIdentifier
Twitter is changing and stuff will get messy quick! If twitter the platform doesn't change it code, this will run normally! See if an account is really real or just a joke or troll account.

### Working Browsers (Tested)
- Chrome
- Opera
- Edge
- FireFox (Limited Support)

### Manifest v2 Support
All latest browsers still support manifest v2, but I've chosen to build with v3, I rather get used to v3 now than having a set back.

# Why is it only Holo/Cover being tagged?
Starting focus is HoloLive, it's more of a test to see how everything else goes in long term and weather the project is worth it or not. The other Long term plan is to have a public vetting system where then anyone can apply and be accepted if vetted enough by the public. This project starting out is HoloLive based 100%. After the test and if people like it. I will focus and expand out wards and upwards to the general population (or) until Elon decides chrome extensions are illegal. The system will be unbiased and will mainly be held by public response on whether if a person is accepted or not by votes. Though abuse of voting will clearly just be a simple block button of not accept responses from certain people. I will hold no bias on who people vett in or vett out. The system will be manual for a while though as the core back end is set up so for now, you can report issues and suggestions to the issues tab.

### I don't have a GitHub account, but I want to suggest a feature or member.
As of right now, github is the only source of vetting anything. It's more manageable. Though, I do not mind if you send me a message via reddit [u/cyb3rofficial](https://www.reddit.com/user/cyb3rofficial).

### Cool project, can I support you?
Yes. Just say you like using it :) I get the satisfaction of knowing my work isn't being wasted.

### You missed a person! How rude!
:( sorry, if I did miss a member, please make a ticket with the member's twitter handle. I will add it and update the app.
You can check the current database [right here](https://github.com/cyberofficial/VT-TwitterAccountIdentifier/blob/master/VT-TID_Needle/db_list.js). These are the accounts currently tagged.

### Why aren't the Member's model creators tagged as well?
I would need a collective effort of other's to get everyone tagged. This is a ground up project. Just the main channels and retired members are tagged.
As of right now, only the talent and official outlets are tagged as official/real. I will slowly collect the model makers soon. Visit the issue tab and submit a missing member, mama or papa.

* Why retired members too?
     * People are heartless and will still try to fool people by using alt accounts to look like them.

### Are you accepting submissions for model creators?
Yes, but at first. I am fine tuning the system a bit. Each set of user handles will be placed into categories. The HoloLive & Co will have a color code system.
For example: Crew & Co will be a light green color. Mamas and Papas [rig creators] will be a different hue of color but still tagged as trusted.

### What data are ye stealing from me ü¶úüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüö¢
Nothing. The app is open source, you can poke and prod at it, or edit build it your self.
Nothing is collecting data or sending data to remote servers to servers to the dark side of the moon.
Manifest V3 restricts stuff like tracking. Well you can still track people but it really hard to do.

### Will I get banned off twitter for using it?
No, nothing is sent to twitter, nothing is pulled from twitter data wise. All edits to pages are locally done in the browser.

### Will this be published to the Chrome and FF store?
Starting out? No, I would like to work a bit more before actually letting be sent off to masses and complain that something is broken.
Right now The application is created in Manifest v3, works best on chrome. Features will come to chrome first then will be back ported to Firefox.

### Will the app auto update?
No. You'll need to check back often for updates. Though right now. The core system is already in place. You can use the application right now, and even add your own user handles to the data base in here [in the database file](https://github.com/cyberofficial/VT-TwitterAccountIdentifier/blob/master/VT-TID_Needle/db_list.js). Really simple to do. Just all the all lower case version of the handle to the file in double quotes and comma separated. Basic CSV formatting.
